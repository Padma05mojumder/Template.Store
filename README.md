**Open the VS Code Terminal:**

In VS Code, open the integrated terminal by pressing Ctrl + (backtick) or by selecting Terminal > New Terminal from the top menu.

Navigate to your desired directory (optional, but recommended):

Use the cd (change directory) command to move to where you want to save the project (e.g., `cd Documents/Projects`).

**Clone the repository:**

On the GitHub (or other Git hosting service) repository page, click the `< >` Code button and copy the HTTPS URL.

In the VS Code terminal, type git clone followed by the URL you copied, then press Enter.


> ### git clone <repository-url>

Example: `git clone github.com`

**Open the project folder:**

After the cloning is complete, a new folder with the repository's name will appear. Navigate into this new directory using the cd command.

> ### cd <repository-name>

**Install dependencies:**
Once you are inside the project folder, install the necessary dependencies listed in the package.json file.

> ### npm install


**Run the project:**

Start the development server using the command specified in the project's package.json file (typically dev or start). For Vite projects, it is usually npm run dev.
bash
> ### npm run dev
**View the application:**

The terminal will display a local URL (e.g., http://localhost:5173/). You can click on this link (or copy and paste it into your browser) to view your running React Vite application.
